# Frontend Masters: Electron (Version 2)

You'll _need_ a recent version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed on your computer with administrative access. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is not required, but [Electron Forge](https://electronforge.io/) uses it, so it would be helpful to [install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) beforehand.

Please make sure you're using a [supported platform](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-platforms). This is _particularly_ important if you're running Linux.

Important note: If you're using Windows, make sure you're _not_ using the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This will confuse Electron to thinking you're running on a Linux machine when you're really not.

We'll be using working through the following repositories over the course of the workshop:

- [firesale](https://github.com/electron-in-action/firesale-fem-v2)
- [clipmaster](https://github.com/electron-in-action/clipmaster-fem-v2)
- [firesale-packaging-and-reporting](https://github.com/electron-in-action/firesale-packaging-and-reporting-fem-v2)
- [electron-crash-report-server](https://github.com/electron-in-action/electron-crash-report-server-fem-v2)
- [clipmaster-spectron](https://github.com/electron-in-action/clipmaster-spectron-fem-v2)
